Observations:

- ~84% of the cost comes from S3 Standard storage.
- ~16% is from Glacier Instant Retrieval — suggesting a lifecycle policy is in place.
- Request & retrieval costs are negligible, indicating infrequent access.
- No data transfer out costs, so data isn’t being downloaded to the internet or other regions.
- Gradual increase in storage cost month-over-month — likely due to growing object size or longer retention.

Recommendations:

1. Review Lifecycle Policy:
   - Consider transitioning data to Glacier Flexible Retrieval or Deep Archive if access is rare.
   
2. Evaluate Retention:
   - Identify stale data that can be archived or deleted to cut ByteHrs storage cost.

3. Enable S3 Storage Lens:
   - For deeper per-bucket and object-age insights.

4. Set Budget Alerts:
   - Notify when S3 monthly cost exceeds a threshold (e.g., $150).
